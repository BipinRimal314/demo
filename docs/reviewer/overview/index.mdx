EkLine treats documentation like code. We lint your prose, enforce your style guide, and catch errors before they merge.

## How EkLine works

EkLine provides two AI-powered tools for documentation:

### Docs reviewer — quality assurance for docs

The Docs Reviewer agent runs in your CI/CD pipeline and reviews documentation changes in every Pull Request. It catches:

- **Style violations** — Active voice, sentence length, readability
- **Grammar issues** — Spelling, punctuation, syntax
- **Terminology inconsistencies** — Enforce product names, technical terms
- **Structural problems** — Heading hierarchy, link validity

When issues occur, EkLine posts inline comments directly on the PR. You can configure it to block merges until you resolve the issues.

**Supported platforms:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Bitbucket Pipelines

### Docs Agent — AI-powered documentation generation

The Docs Agent analyzes your codebase and generates documentation automatically:

- **API references** from function signatures and types
- **README files** with project overviews
- **Getting started guides** for onboarding

Access it from the [EkLine dashboard](https://ekline.io/dashboard) or directly in VSCode.

## Configuration

EkLine is fully customizable. You can manage rules, have custom guidelines, implement AI rules, add company specific terminology, and configure your own dictionary for your documentation creation and review.

<Aside type="tip">
Start with a preset style guide (Google, Microsoft, or Marketing) and customize from there.
