## Not sure which to pick?

| Where do your docs live? | Use this |
|--------------------------|----------|
| GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repo | [GitHub Action](/reviewer/quickstart/github-action/) |
| Writing locally in VS Code | [VS Code](/reviewer/quickstart/vscode/) |
| Google Docs, Notion, or other tools | [Google Docs](/reviewer/quickstart/google-docs/) |

<Aside type="tip">
Most teams use **GitHub Action** for CI/CD enforcement and **VS Code** for real-time feedback while writing. They work great together.
