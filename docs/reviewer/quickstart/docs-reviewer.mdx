EkLine's Docs Reviewer agent catches style, grammar, and terminology issues in your documentation before they merge. This guide gets you from zero to automated PR reviews in under 5 minutes.

## What you get

- Automated documentation review on every Pull Request
- Inline comments pointing to specific issues
- Style guide enforcement (Google, Microsoft, or custom)
- Merge blocking for critical violations

<Steps>

1. **Get your EkLine token**

   Sign up at [ekline.io](https://ekline.io) and copy your integration token from the [Dashboard](https://ekline.io/dashboard).

2. **Add the token to your repository**

   Go to your GitHub repository:

   **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

   - Name: `EK_TOKEN`
   - Value: *paste your token*

3. **Create the workflow file**

   Create `.github/workflows/ekline.yml` in your repository:

   ```yaml
   name: EkLine Docs Review
   on:
     pull_request:

   jobs:
     review-docs:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       permissions:
         contents: read
         pull-requests: write
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - uses: ekline-io/ekline-github-action@v6
           with:
             content_dir: ./docs
             ek_token: ${{ secrets.EK_TOKEN }}
             github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
             reporter: github-pr-review
   ```

   <Aside type="tip">
   Change `content_dir` to match your documentation folder (e.g., `./src/docs`, `./content`, or `.` for root).
   </Aside>

4. **Open a Pull Request**

   Commit the workflow file and open a PR with documentation changes. EkLine will automatically review and comment on any issues.

</Steps>

## You're done

EkLine is now reviewing your documentation on every PR. You see inline comments like:

> **EK00042**: Consider using active voice. "The configuration is loaded" → "Load the configuration"

## Next steps

- [Configure filter modes](/reviewer/integrations/github-integration/#filter-modes) to control what gets reviewed
- [Ignore specific rules](/reviewer/integrations/github-integration/#ignoring-specific-rules) that don't apply to your project
- [Set up GitLab](/reviewer/integrations/gitlab-integration/) or [Bitbucket](/reviewer/integrations/bitbucket-integration/) instead

## Common configurations

### Review only changed lines (default)

```yaml
filter_mode: added
```

### Review entire changed files

```yaml
filter_mode: file
```

### Exclude directories

```yaml
exclude-directories: "node_modules,tests,vendor"
```

### Use a custom style guide

```yaml
style-guide: "./.ekline-style-guide.yml"
```

See the full [GitHub Integration guide](/reviewer/integrations/github-integration/) for all options.
