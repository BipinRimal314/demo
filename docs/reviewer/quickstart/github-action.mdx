Checks run automatically on every Pull Request. Most users catch 2-3 issues they didn't know existed on their first run.

<Steps>

1. **Copy your token**

   Go to your [EkLine Dashboard](https://ekline.io/dashboard) and copy your integration token.

2. **Add it to GitHub**

   In your repository: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

   | Field | Value |
   |-------|-------|
   | Name | `EK_TOKEN` |
   | Secret | *your token* |

   <img
       className={'rounded-2xl'}
       width={1880}
       height={1044}
       src={`/assets/images/github-secrets-setup.png`}
       alt={`Adding EK_TOKEN to GitHub repository secrets`}
   />


3. **Create the workflow**. Go to **Action → New Workflow  → set up a workflow yourself**.

   Add this file to your repo at `.github/workflows/ekline.yml`:

   ```yaml
   name: EkLine
   on: [pull_request]

   jobs:
     docs:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       permissions:
         contents: read
         pull-requests: write
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - uses: ekline-io/ekline-github-action@v6
           with:
             content_dir: .
             ek_token: ${{ secrets.EK_TOKEN }}
             github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
             reporter: github-pr-review
   ```

   <Aside type="tip">
   Set `content_dir` to your docs folder (e.g., `./docs`, `./content`). Use `.` to scan everything.
   </Aside>

4. **Open a PR**

   Commit the workflow and open a Pull Request. EkLine reviews it automatically.

</Steps>

## That's it

You can see inline comments on your PR like:

> **EK00005**: Where possible, don't structure sentences in future tense. Use present tense instead.

<img
    className={'rounded-2xl'}
    width={1880}
    height={1044}
    src={`/assets/images/github-action-pr-review.png`}
    alt={`Example of EkLine review comments on a GitHub Pull Request`}
/>
