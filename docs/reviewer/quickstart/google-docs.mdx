## When to use Google Docs

| Use case | Best tool |
|----------|-----------|
| README, API docs, guides in your repo | [GitHub Action](/reviewer/quickstart/github-action/) or [VS Code](/reviewer/quickstart/vscode/) |
| Product specs, PRDs, proposals | **Google Docs** |
| Wiki pages, Notion exports | **Google Docs** |
| Drafts before committing to repo | **Google Docs** |

<Aside type="tip">
Once your doc is ready, move it to your repo and set up the [GitHub Action](/reviewer/quickstart/github-action/) to keep it consistent.
</Aside>
