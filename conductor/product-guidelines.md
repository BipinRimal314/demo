# Product Guidelines: Ekline Website

## Brand Voice & Tone
- **Bold & Provocative:** We challenge the status quo. Documentation isn't just "outdated"—it's broken. We speak with the urgency of a developer fixing a production bug.
- **Modern & Minimalist:** Our communication is direct and tech-forward. We value clarity over fluff, mirroring the efficiency of the product itself.
- **Authoritative:** We position ourselves as experts who understand the deep pain of documentation debt and have the definitive solution.

## Visual Identity & Design Principles
- **Dual-Theme Excellence:**
    - **Dark Mode (Primary):** A sophisticated, high-contrast aesthetic that feels natural to developers and engineers.
    - **Light Mode:** A polished, clean alternative that ensures accessibility and caters to all user preferences.
- **Clean Typography:** Prioritize readability with modern sans-serif fonts and generous line heights.
- **Spacious Layouts:** Use whitespace strategically to reduce cognitive load and focus attention on key messages and calls to action.
- **Subtle Interactivity:** Utilize smooth animations and transitions (via Framer Motion) to create a premium, reactive user experience without being distracting.

## Messaging Strategy: "Documentation is Broken"
- **The Problem:** Explicitly highlight the high cost of stale documentation—lost productivity, developer frustration, and the erosion of customer trust.
- **The Philosophy:** Treat documentation errors as bugs. A typo in a README is a minor issue; a functional inaccuracy is a system failure.
- **The Solution:** Position Ekline as the automated "cure" that synchronizes documentation with the speed of code execution.
- **Proof Points:** Use relatable engineering anecdotes and data-driven insights to validate the "trust gap" caused by poor documentation.
